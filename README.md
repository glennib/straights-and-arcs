# Straights and arcs
Simple MATLAB library to do waypoint reduce waypoints and connect them with straight lines and circle arcs.

The reduction doesn't work in this repository due to a dependency on another library for checking collision, but it's possible to look at the code to understand what is needed to make it more general.
Pull requests are appreciated!
